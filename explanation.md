explanation
Sometimes, home pages contain links to files the web browser can’t play or display, such as sound or ani-
mation files. In that case, you need a plug-in or a helper application. You configure your web browser or
operating system to use the helper application or plug-in whenever it encounters a sound, animation, or
other type of file the browser can’t run or play.
Over the years, web browsers have become increasingly sophisticated. Browsers are now full-blown soft-
ware suites that can do everything from videoconferencing to letting you create and publish HTML pages.
Browsers now also blur the line between your local computer and the Internet—in essence, they can make
your computer and the Internet function as a single computer system.
Increasingly, a browser is not just a single piece of software, but an entire suite. The newest version of
Internet Explorer, for example, includes security features such as an anti-phishing filter. The Firefox browser
has a companion piece of email software called Thunderbird that can be downloaded as well.
